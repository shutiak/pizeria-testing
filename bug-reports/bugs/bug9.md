# BUG-009: Text on Black Button in Footer Not Visible Until Hovered

**Environment:**
- Device: Windows 11  
- Browser: Chrome 138.0  
- URL: https://simply33food.com/en/  
- Language: EN  

---

### Preconditions:
- User is on the English version of the homepage (`/en/`)

---

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll to the footer of the homepage  
2. Locate the section with the heading **"Want a Discount?"**  
3. Observe the black button located below the heading  
4. Hover over the button  

---

### Actual Result:
- Button text is only visible on hover. Without hovering, the black text blends into the black background, making it nearly invisible and easily missed.

### Expected Result:
- Button text should be clearly visible at all times. The button should be styled in a way that makes it recognizable and accessible, indicating that it leads to more information about discount conditions.
